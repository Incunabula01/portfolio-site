This web app is one of my side projects developed using the Next.js framework. With this application, I utilized the framework to build a web app based on the Cocktail DB REST API. Another notable feature of this app is JSON Web Token authentication, enabling users to log in and save their favorite cocktails to a MongoDB instance.

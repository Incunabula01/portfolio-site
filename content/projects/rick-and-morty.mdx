This project served as an employment pre-screening exercise, involving the creation of a web app using the Next.js framework and integrating a REST API. The task involved utilizing the Rick and Morty API to enable filtering by episodes, implementing infinite scrolling, and incorporating a collapsible mobile menu for mobile phone displays. The application's UI was designed with a Rick and Morty-inspired color palette and fonts, employing the Tailwind CSS framework.

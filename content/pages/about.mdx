##  Hi! ðŸ‘‹

With over a decade of experience in UI/UX development, I've honed my skills in creating intuitive and user-friendly experiences. I've had the privilege of working with top companies like Riot Games and Allegis Group, leading projects that streamline workflows and boost application efficiency. At Riot Games, I revamped React components, reducing bugs and improving developer workflows for their Portal DevOps Platform. At Allegis Group, I crafted bespoke solutions in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, contributing to cutting-edge Salesforce and React applications.

In addition to my development skills, I bring a strong background in UX design. I blend creativity with technical expertise to create impactful digital experiences that drive business success. I've created wireframes and mockups to refine user experiences and collaborated closely with UX designers to further refine them, resulting in notable enhancements to overall user experiences.
